This is a case study of TSRTC getting heavy losses.
# This is a case study of TSRTC getting heavy losses.

### Approach:
* There are different types of passengers travelling in a bus. Having the data of different types of users, the daily distance they travel, Fare they pay etc.. and analysing this data to identify patterns and develop efficient methods to avoid losses can save our state owned RTC. Using various methods of visualization and Machine Learning this problem can be efficiently solved (if data is available).

# Private travels are under high profits whereas TSRTC can't run in profits?
